# Word-Guessing-Game

## Description:
This Python project is a simple word guessing game similar to "Hangman." The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word letter by letter. The player continues guessing until they either complete the word or choose to stop playing. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displaying the word progressively as letters are guessed correctly.

## Features
- Randomly selects a word from a list of programming languages (e.g., "PYTHON", "JAVASCRIPT", etc.).
- Displays the word with underscores for letters that haven't been guessed yet.
- Validates user input to ensure only single alphabetical characters are entered.
- Tracks and displays both correct and incorrect guesses.
- Allows the player to replay after completing a word.

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
